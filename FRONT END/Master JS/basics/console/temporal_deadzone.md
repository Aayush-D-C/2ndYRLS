The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript that affects variables declared with let and const. It’s a time period during which these variables exist but cannot be accessed because they haven't been initialized yet.

How the Temporal Dead Zone Works
When the JavaScript engine encounters a let or const declaration, it allocates memory for the variable but doesn’t initialize it immediately.
Until the code execution reaches the line where the variable is defined, any attempt to access it will throw a ReferenceError.
The variable remains in this "dead zone" from the start of the block (or the start of the function or script) until the point where the declaration is encountered and initialized.
This behavior contrasts with var declarations, which are hoisted and initialized as undefined at the beginning of their scope, meaning you can access them before the declaration without throwing an error (though it would return undefined).

Example of Temporal Dead Zone
javascript
Copy code
console.log(myVar);   // undefined
console.log(myLet);   // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization

var myVar = 10;
let myLet = 20;
In this example:

myVar is hoisted, so it exists at the start of the scope and initializes to undefined, allowing it to be logged without an error (even though it's not yet assigned 10).
myLet, declared with let, is in the Temporal Dead Zone until its declaration is encountered, so attempting to access it beforehand throws a ReferenceError.
Why the Temporal Dead Zone Exists
The Temporal Dead Zone encourages predictable code and reduces potential bugs:

It prevents accidental access to variables before they are initialized, which might lead to unexpected behavior.
It ensures that const variables cannot be accessed before their initialization, supporting the intent of immutability.
Key Points to Remember
TDZ applies only to let and const declarations, not var.
ReferenceError is thrown if a variable in the TDZ is accessed.
The TDZ ends once the variable is initialized, and it becomes available for use.
Scoping rules apply—TDZ exists within the block scope for block-scoped variables.
