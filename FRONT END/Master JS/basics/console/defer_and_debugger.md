1. defer Attribute in JavaScript
The defer attribute is used in the <script> tag in HTML. It’s helpful when loading JavaScript files and can improve webpage loading speed and performance by optimizing how scripts load.

How defer Works
When a script has defer applied (<script src="script.js" defer></script>), the script waits to execute until the HTML document is fully parsed.
The script is loaded in the background while the HTML is being parsed, but it won’t run until the document is fully loaded.
If there are multiple defer scripts, they run in the order they appear in the HTML.
Why Use defer?
Improves Page Load Performance: Scripts are loaded without blocking the HTML parsing, leading to faster page loading times.
Safe for DOM Manipulation: Since defer scripts only run after the HTML is parsed, they have access to the entire DOM.
Example:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="script1.js" defer></script>
    <script src="script2.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
</body>
</html>
In this example, script1.js and script2.js will execute only after the HTML document is fully parsed, and they’ll run in sequence.

2. debugger Keyword in JavaScript
The debugger statement is a keyword in JavaScript used to manually trigger a debugging session in the browser’s developer tools. It pauses the execution of JavaScript at the point where debugger is written, allowing you to inspect values, watch expressions, and step through code.

How debugger Works
When JavaScript execution reaches a debugger statement, it stops running if the browser's developer tools are open.
You can then inspect variables, watch the call stack, and evaluate expressions, which is useful for understanding bugs or unexpected behavior in your code.
Why Use debugger?
Identify Bugs: Helps developers stop code execution at a specific point to inspect values or conditions.
Interactive: Unlike console.log, you can explore different scopes, view the state of the entire code, and even modify values to test outcomes.
Step-by-Step Execution: Allows you to step through your code to see exactly where things might be going wrong.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    let result = a + b;
    debugger; // Execution will pause here if DevTools is open
    return result;
}

calculateSum(5, 3);
When the browser encounters debugger;, it will pause code execution, allowing you to inspect the result variable and see if it holds the expected value.

Key Differences Between defer and debugger
defer is used in HTML to control when JavaScript files execute, mainly for optimization.
debugger is a JavaScript keyword used within the code to pause execution for debugging purposes.
Both are powerful tools to ensure your JavaScript code runs smoothly and efficiently!
