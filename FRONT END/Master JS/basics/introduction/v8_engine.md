V8 Engine Documentation Overview
The V8 Engine is Google’s high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, designed to run JavaScript code efficiently. It powers both the Chrome browser and the Node.js runtime, offering fast execution, garbage collection, and memory management. This README provides an overview of V8’s key features, architecture, and links to essential documentation for developers and contributors.

Key Features
1. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation
V8 uses JIT compilation to convert JavaScript code into machine code at runtime for optimized performance. It features:

Ignition: V8’s interpreter, which compiles JavaScript to bytecode quickly.
TurboFan: The optimizing compiler that generates highly optimized machine code based on execution profiling.
2. Garbage Collection
The V8 engine uses an automated garbage collector to manage memory. It reclaims memory from unused objects to prevent leaks, ensuring efficient memory usage for both client and server environments.

3. Memory Optimization
V8 employs advanced techniques for efficient memory usage:

Hidden Classes: V8 dynamically creates hidden classes to speed up object property access.
Inline Caching: Reuses compiled functions to optimize repeated calls and property access.
4. WebAssembly Support
V8 fully supports WebAssembly (Wasm), allowing compiled languages like C++ and Rust to run in browser or server environments, improving performance and broadening the V8’s use cases.
