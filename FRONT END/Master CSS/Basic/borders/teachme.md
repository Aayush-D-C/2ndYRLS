Understanding the / in border-image

In the CSS border-image property, the forward slash (/) is used to separate different components of the declaration. In the specific example you provided:

CSS
border-image: url('path-to-image.png') 30 fill / 10px / 5px stretch;
Use code with caution.

The / separates the border-image-width and border-image-outset values.

Here's a breakdown of the components:

url('path-to-image.png'): Specifies the image source.
30: Sets the slicing of the image into nine regions. This value indicates that the image should be sliced into 30% segments from each edge.
fill: Determines how the sliced regions are repeated to fill the border. fill means the image will be repeated to fill the entire border.
10px: Sets the border-image-width. This defines the width of the border image on each side.
5px: Sets the border-image-outset. This defines the distance between the border image and the element's border box.
stretch: Sets the border-image-repeat property, specifying how the image is repeated to fill the border. stretch means the image will be stretched to fit the available space.
In summary, the / in this context is used to separate different parts of the border-image declaration, allowing you to control the image source, slicing, width, outset, and repetition.
